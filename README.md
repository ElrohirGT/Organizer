## How to use
1. Download the corresponding version for your Operating System and unzip the file (this can be anywhere in your machine).
2. How to run the application:
   - If you're on windows find the exe inside the folder and double click it.
   - If you're on mac, copy the folder to "Aplications" and type ComicOrganizer, it should appear a black miniature with green text, press enter.
You can create shortcuts (windows) for the exe and move them to your desktop.
3. First answer the questions:
   - If you want to log all files (all images) from each directory then type "y".
   - How many comics do you want to have minimum per artist or group, the recommended quantity is 2 because that ensures that the ones that are left untouched are unique.
   - Do you want to organize previous comics, this option should be marked "y" when it could be that some comics are already organized in their group but with not enough.
   - The path that you want to organize, all organized comics will end up inside this path. If you are in windows just copy the path that is on the explorer, in case of mac you don't need to escape the path so if you have backslashes (\) then erase them. For example:
     - This: Users/user/Test\ Comics
     - Correct it to: Users/user/Test Comics
4. Wait for it to complete.

## Caveats
1. It works slowly on a external drive, it's probably because the writing speed of most flashdrives is slower than the actual speed of your computer, have patience.
2. I tried it with a directory with ~1,200 different comics, it worked fine, it couldn't copy just 4 comics, I'm working on making this better but I thought it was good enough to publish it, it was on an external drive so it took almost 2 hours.
3. It is recommended that the files are inside your computer and not in some external drive.

## What's next
1. I'll try adding different languages, spanish is definitvely one of them.
2. I'm working on making the log more modern, and small, so it doesn't spams the console.
3. Add config files so that you can change the format in which directories are created.
